# Sales_Strategy_Board_Games
###### - I am an employee of a retail company and it is my job to analyse the following dataset "board_games.csv" which is based on board games. This analysis will help determine the sales strategy for the company I work for in their upcoming Winter season.   ###### - All questions will be answered using separate visualizations that will uncover helpful insights.   ###### - All decisions in this report will be rationalized in order to evidence and prove to The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) why a certain decision and outcome was made/reached.   ###### - The rationalization includes the visualization of design decisions, how the data was engineered, feature selection and any other information that is relevant.
